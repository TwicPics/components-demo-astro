<Layout title="TwicPics - Short Videos">
  <main>
    <Wrapper title="Short Videos">
      <p>
        The ideal candidates for TwicPics video integration are hero videos,
        product videos, and thumbnails.
      </p>
      <p>
        All videos generated by the TwicPics API are muted, to be looped and
        played automatically. You can think of them as GIFs, but with high
        quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        The TwicVideo component automatically handles CLS, LQIP and the display
        of a generated poster until the video is actually viewable.
      </p>
      <p>
        This feature is available <strong
          >for all our Pro and Enterprise customers</strong
        >.
